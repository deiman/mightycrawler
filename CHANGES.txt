Version 0.4, sept 2, 2011

* Split configuration of (http) response encoding and file (output) encoding
* Supports multiple start URLs for crawling
* Supports using list of URLs as input (thus disabling crawling)
* Downloaded HTML (along with the URL) is stored inside XML files. Direct URL-to-file-path mapping is abandoned due to:
- URLs can be longer than file system naming limits (in Windows the limit is 255 characters)
- URLs can contain characters not allowed in file names (in Windows, "?" and ":" are not allowed)
- http://www.server.com/test and http://www.server.com/test/ are different resources but would map to a single file name
unless some kind of magic mapping were applied
* Packaging is based on mvn assembly plugin
